# Neo4js Improved

After some time we've been unable to find a full featured Wrapper for Neo4j's REST API that 
performed all the tasks that we needed so we've begun to start our own. Once this projects hits
a beta release candidate we'll integrate into the NPM repository but until then the source will
be available here.
